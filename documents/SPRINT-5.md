# SPRINT 05

__SPECIAL BLACKBOX TESTING SPRINT: ALL WORK DUE FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 10__.

## Working Directory

Note the "dev" directory in the repository. This is where all of our work will be done.

We have started writing the code, so you have a framework to attach your features to. Note that there is no code in the "global" space; everything is in Javascript pseudo-classes. The latest ECMA standard supports object-oriented syntax (actual classes, as opposed to functions defined on functions), but it is not fully supported across all of our target devices/browsers.

Before you examine the code or run it, you may want the check out doc/buildGraphDemo.mp4 to see what it does.

One thing that might be confusing is where to use "this" and where to use "self." For certain class functions that are passed to D3 functions, for example, the class goes out of scope, and "this" refers to the D3 object, not the class on which the function is defined. To refer to the class on which such a function is defined, we pass the class object as a variable "self."

Our objective for now is to work only with d3.js and SVG; we will not be using any other Javascript libraries (not even jQuery), and we will do our best to avoid CSS.

## Testing

Before pushing code and requesting a merge to develop, verify that your code works on the __LATEST VERSIONS__ of the following:

### Windows desktop

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Edge

### Mac Desktop

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari

### iPhone/iPad

* Safari

### Android

* Chrome
* Firefox

You may need to work together, checking out each other's branches, to cover all of these device/browser combinations.
 
## Sprint Assignments :

__FOR ALL STUDENTS: execute blackbox.md tests and manually exercise all functionality of the app, exploring potential edge cases. Complete testing on Friday, November 10 and report on Wednesday, November 22.__
