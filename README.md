### Overview
This course provides an opportunity for students to apply the skills they've acquired in the course of pursuing their degree to a collaboratively implemented software project suitable for deployment in the real world. We will work together to fix bugs and code new features for an existing mobile game.

### Process
Every two weeks a new set of features and bug fixes will be assigned to teams and/or individuals by the professor. Assigned work must be completed within the two-week "sprint." All project participants will have tasks during the sprint. GitHub will be used to manage software and documentation for the project. Each team leader will push completed work to their own copy of the development branch and open a PR (pull request). The professor, and potentially or one of the more experienced coders in the class, will evaluate the pull request. Both evaluators will provide comments requesting changes, if needed, and the committer will be required to fix and push to his/her remote copy of the branch until the work is considered complete. Complete work is merged into the main development branch. Each day we will have a brief standup meeting to determine where we are, individually and as a group.

### Grading
Grading will be based on (1) submission of an initial pull request one week from the date of assignment, and (2) the number of pull request/evaluation cycles (minus the first) required to complete an assigned task within the two-week sprint. For example, if the first pull request following the initial is approved for merge immediately, an 'A+' is awarded. The grade will fall one letter grade (i.e. B -> B-) for each additional pull request required to fix it. If the work is not completed by the end of the sprint, an 'F' is assigned for that task. Grades will be posted on blackboard at the end of each sprint.

There are 8 pull request/evaluation cycles (sprints).

* Initial pull requests, due one week after sprint assignments, are worth 30% of the final grade (3.75% each); these are pass/fail, based on whether they are submitted or not.
* Final pull requests (including all updates required to complete them), are worth 70% of your grade (8.75% each).

### Requirements
* Attendance is required at every class. The majority of work is done collaboratively in a lab environment, and everyone's objectives are interdependent.
* Every student must bring a USB drive or his/her own laptop. USB drives must be formatted for the Mac OS Extended file system.

### Schedule
#### Friday, August 25: Orientation
* Introduction to the game and associated codebase.
* All students clone the repository onto their USB drives. 
* The majority of students will familiarize themselves with the code by adding a test feature on a local copy of the "develop" branch: make all edges turn blue and all vertices turn yellow when a particular button is clicked; other students with experience in the codebase will review stale PR's and branches.
